            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey I'm Davis Kim, I've spent most of my life in the midwestern region of the US, besides one year in LA. I grew up in Minneapolis, MN and went to school in Madison, Wi. I currently work at PFF: "Pro Football Focus" as an analyst. I'm passionate about football and football analytics, so most of my outside interests and academic/professional output has found a way to translate to that as well. I have an analytic mindset and want to give everyone a taste of those interests through this webpage.

            <h2>Academic Research</h2>
            <p>
                I completed my undergaduate education at UW-Madision with a major in economics. I focused most of my inter-diciplinary studies on data analytics and econometrics. I have included two of my research papers one dealing with forecasting draft pick value between NFL conferences & the other forecasting GDP in 2020.

            <h2>Coding Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                Currently I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp with the University of Minnesota. Throughout this course I will continue to update this section. Currently, I have an example from a homework assignment of a functional webpage for a mock marketing firm called "Horiseon".
